# v1.0 Milestone Audit Report

**Milestone:** v1.0
**Audited:** 2026-02-19
**Status:** TECH DEBT — All requirements met, no critical blockers, significant accumulated tech debt

## Executive Summary

AXion Hub v1.0 delivers a comprehensive AI agent mission control dashboard across 10 phases with **108 of 109 in-scope requirements satisfied** (1 partial). All 10 phases have been verified. 6 public marketing page requirements (SITE-01 through SITE-06) were explicitly dropped per CONTEXT.md — AXion Hub is an internal tool.

The core product surface is complete: authentication, agent management (13 sub-pages), real-time chat with streaming, command center dashboard, mission board with Kanban, gateway/channel/model management, session/memory/file browsing, approval workflows, skills/plugins, visual workflow builder, comprehensive settings, internal docs, and developer tools.

**No critical blockers exist.** However, significant tech debt has accumulated across all 10 phases, primarily in three categories:
1. **Mock data migration** — All API hooks return mock data; gateway client integration pending
2. **Cross-phase wiring gaps** — 5 integration connections missing (proxy middleware, query key mismatch, chat buttons, alert pipeline, sidebar nav)
3. **Documentation inconsistencies** — REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table partially outdated

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Name | Status | Score | Key Gaps |
|-------|------|--------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Foundation & Infrastructure | passed | 11/11 | — |
| 2 | Authentication & App Shell | passed | 12/12 | proxy.ts not mounted (integration) |
| 3 | Agent Management | passed | 19/19 | — |
| 4 | Real-Time Chat | passed | 22/22 | New Chat buttons no-op (integration) |
| 5 | Dashboard & Monitoring | passed | 5/5 | Alert pipeline non-functional (integration) |
| 6 | Mission Board | passed* | 13/14→14/14 | *Gap closed: initMissionStoreSubscriptions now called |
| 7 | Gateway, Channels & Models | passed | 19/19 | — |
| 8 | Sessions, Memory, Files & Gov | partial | 26/27 | SessionsTable row click fragile workaround |
| 9 | Skills, Plugins & Workflows | passed | 17/17 | — |
| 10 | Settings, Docs & Dev Tools | passed | 16/16 | — |

**Phase 6 correction:** The Phase 6 VERIFICATION (2026-02-18) flagged `initMissionStoreSubscriptions` as not called in GatewayProvider. The integration checker confirmed this gap is **now closed** — `gateway-provider.tsx` line 86 calls it with proper cleanup.

## Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

### Source Availability

| Source | Available | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| VERIFICATION.md (per-phase) | 10/10 phases | Primary source — comprehensive requirements tables |
| SUMMARY.md frontmatter | 0/53 plans | No `requirements_completed` field in any SUMMARY — pre-dates convention |
| REQUIREMENTS.md traceability | 115/115 mapped | 11 INFR checkboxes stale (`[ ]` but satisfied); 6 SITE stale (`Pending` but dropped) |

### Requirements Status

| Category | Total | Satisfied | Partial | Dropped | Unsatisfied |
|----------|-------|-----------|---------|---------|-------------|
| INFR (Phase 1) | 11 | 11 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| AUTH (Phase 2) | 6 | 6 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| AGNT (Phase 3) | 13 | 13 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

**In-scope: 109 | Satisfied: 108 | Partial: 1 | Unsatisfied: 0**

### Partial Requirement Detail

**SESS-01** — "User can view all active sessions across all agents at /sessions"

| Source | Status | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Phase 8 VERIFICATION | PARTIAL | handleRowClick defined but DataTable lacks onRowClick prop |
| SUMMARY frontmatter | N/A | No requirements_completed field |
| REQUIREMENTS.md | `[x]` / Complete | Checkbox marked |

**Assessment:** SessionsTable renders correctly in both flat and grouped modes. Row click navigation uses a DOM event delegation workaround (wrapper div with onClick) that is functional with current mock data but fragile — would break with virtual scrolling or row reordering. Not a blocker but should be hardened.

### Dropped Requirements

SITE-01 through SITE-06 (landing page, features, pricing, docs, changelog, blog) were explicitly dropped per CONTEXT.md: "AXion Hub is an internal mission control tool, not a SaaS product." The ROADMAP.md Phase 10 notes confirm: "SITE-01 through SITE-06 are DROPPED per CONTEXT.md."

**Action needed:** Update REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table to show status "Dropped" instead of "Pending" for SITE-01 through SITE-06.

### Orphaned Requirements

None. All 115 requirements in the traceability table are assigned to phases and verified.

### Stale Checkboxes

INFR-01 through INFR-11 are marked `[ ]` (unchecked) in REQUIREMENTS.md but are all SATISFIED per Phase 1 VERIFICATION. The traceability table shows "Pending" but Phase 1 is complete.

**Action needed:** Update INFR-01 through INFR-11 checkboxes to `[x]` and traceability status to "Complete".

## Cross-Phase Integration

### Missing Connections (5)

| # | Issue | Affected Requirements | Severity |
|---|-------|----------------------|----------|
| MC-01 | `proxy.ts` never mounted as Next.js middleware — no `middleware.ts` at project root | AUTH-06 | Medium — layout auth still protects routes |
| MC-02 | TanStack Query key mismatch: `useAgents` caches `["agents"]`, `AgentPickerDialog` queries `["agents","list"]` | CHAT-01, AGNT-01 | Medium — picker still fetches, but cache is wasted |
| MC-03 | Agent detail "Send Message" quick action still disabled post-Phase 4 | AGNT-02 | Low — user can navigate to /chat/[agentId] directly |
| MC-04 | "New Chat" and "Start Chat" buttons in chat hub/sidebar are no-ops | CHAT-01 | Medium — user can navigate to /chat/[agentId] directly |
| MC-05 | Alert notification pipeline end-to-end broken (hardcoded false + no DB→client bridge) | MNTR-04 | Low — intentional mock; requires live gateway data |

### E2E Flow Status

| Flow | Status | Break Point |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Login → Dashboard → View widgets | Complete | — |
| Login → Agents → Create → View in roster | Complete | — |
| Login → Missions → Create task → Drag on board | Complete | — |
| Login → Settings → All 9 sections | Complete | — |
| Agent creation → appears in Chat picker | Broken | Query key mismatch + New Chat no-op |
| Alert rule creation → Notification delivery | Broken | Worker hardcode + missing bridge |
| Sessions list → Session detail (grouped) | Fragile | DOM event delegation workaround |

## Tech Debt Summary

| Phase | Items | Category |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Foundation | 2 | Minor (date picker, checkbox update) |
| 2. Authentication | 2 | Medium (proxy.ts mount, org creation placeholder) |
| 3. Agent Management | 4 | Medium (7 mock hooks, type error, dead export, disabled button) |
| 4. Real-Time Chat | 6 | Medium (mock hooks, upload placeholder, no-op buttons) |
| 5. Dashboard & Monitoring | 4 | Medium (alert pipeline, mock hooks, no task sync) |
| 6. Mission Board | 2 | Minor (console.log placeholders, access management) |
| 7. Gateway/Channels/Models | 3 | Medium (5 mock hooks, independent mock data) |
| 8. Sessions/Memory/Files/Gov | 4 | Medium (row click fragile, disabled upload button, mock hooks) |
| 9. Skills/Plugins/Workflows | 2 | Minor (avatar placeholder, all mock data) |
| 10. Settings/Docs/Dev Tools | 3 | Medium (OAuth stubs, mock persistence, stale traceability) |
| **Total** | **32 items across 10 phases** | |

### Tech Debt Categories

1. **Mock data migration (systemic)** — Every phase uses mock data in API hooks with `// TODO: Replace with gatewayClient.*` comments. This is the largest single category of tech debt and is by design — the entire v1.0 was built UI-first with mock data.

2. **Cross-phase wiring polish (5 items)** — proxy.ts mount, query key alignment, chat button wiring, alert pipeline bridge, sidebar nav completeness.

3. **Documentation staleness (2 items)** — REQUIREMENTS.md checkboxes and SITE traceability status need updating.

4. **Minor UX polish (various)** — disabled buttons, console.log placeholders, basic date picker, avatar placeholders.

## Scores

- **Requirements:** 108/109 in-scope satisfied (99.1%)
- **Phases:** 10/10 verified (8 passed, 1 corrected, 1 partial)
- **Integration:** 18/23 connections wired (78.3%)
- **E2E Flows:** 4/7 complete (57.1%)
- **Tech debt items:** 32 across 10 phases
