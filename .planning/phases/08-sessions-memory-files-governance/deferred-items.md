# Deferred Items - Phase 08

## Pre-existing TypeScript Errors (Out of Scope)

These errors exist in untracked files from other Phase 8 plans, not caused by 08-01:

1. **src/features/workspace/components/code-editor.tsx** - exactOptionalPropertyTypes issue with CodeMirror onChange/readOnly props
2. **src/views/governance/policies-view.tsx** - editPolicy prop type mismatch (PolicyRule | undefined vs PolicyRule)
