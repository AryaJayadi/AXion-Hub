<objective>
Add all 7 missing sidebar navigation links and update REQUIREMENTS.md traceability to 100% accuracy.

Purpose: Complete sidebar navigation makes all existing pages discoverable. Accurate traceability ensures the project audit trail is correct for v1.0 milestone.
Output: Updated navigation.ts with 20 links across 4 groups; updated REQUIREMENTS.md with correct checkbox states and phase mappings.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add 7 missing sidebar navigation links</name>
  <files>src/widgets/app-shell/config/navigation.ts</files>
  <action>
Update `src/widgets/app-shell/config/navigation.ts` to add 7 missing sidebar links per the locked sidebar structure decision:

1. Add lucide-react icon imports: `Clock`, `BookOpen`, `MonitorCheck`, `ScrollText`, `FileOutput`, `Package`, `Scale` (or `ShieldCheck` for Governance — use discretion for best visual).

2. Update the `navigationConfig` array to match the locked sidebar structure exactly:

**Core group** (add 2 items):
- `{ title: "Sessions", url: "/sessions", icon: Clock }` — after Missions
- `{ title: "Memory", url: "/memory", icon: BookOpen }` — after Sessions

**Operations group** (add 1 item):
- `{ title: "Monitor", url: "/monitor", icon: MonitorCheck }` — after Files

**Automation group** (add 1 item):
- `{ title: "Plugins", url: "/plugins", icon: Package }` — after Skills

**System group** (add 3 items, reorder):
- `{ title: "Approvals", url: "/approvals", icon: Shield }` — keep existing
- `{ title: "Deliverables", url: "/deliverables", icon: FileOutput }` — new
- `{ title: "Audit", url: "/audit", icon: ScrollText }` — new
- `{ title: "Governance", url: "/governance/policies", icon: Scale }` — new (use Scale icon for governance/compliance feel, distinct from Shield used by Approvals)
- `{ title: "Settings", url: "/settings", icon: Settings }` — keep existing, move to last position

The final config should have 20 items total: Core(6), Operations(6), Automation(3), System(5).

Ensure all existing icon imports are preserved. Only add new imports for icons not already imported.

Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to verify no TypeScript errors in navigation.ts. Visually confirm the file has 4 groups with 6, 6, 3, 5 items respectively.
  </verify>
  <done>
Navigation config contains all 20 links organized into 4 groups matching the locked sidebar structure. All 7 previously missing links (/sessions, /memory, /monitor, /plugins, /deliverables, /audit, /governance/policies) are present.

  <name>Task 2: Update REQUIREMENTS.md traceability accuracy</name>
  <files>.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md</files>
  <action>
Update `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` to ensure 100% traceability accuracy:

1. **SESS-01 status** — Currently shows `- [ ] **SESS-01**` with Phase 11 Pending in traceability table. This is correct; leave as-is. The checkbox will be checked when Phase 11 execution completes.

2. **Verify INFR-01 through INFR-11** — All should show `[x]` checkboxes. Currently they do. Confirm no changes needed.

3. **Verify SITE-01 through SITE-06** — Should show `[ ]` unchecked with Dropped status in traceability table. Currently they do. Confirm no changes needed.

4. **Update the Coverage section** at the bottom to reflect the Phase 11 plan creation:
   - Ensure it reads: "Pending (gap closure): 1 (SESS-01 → Phase 11)"
   - Update "Last updated" date to 2026-02-20

5. **Verify all traceability table entries are correct** — scan the full table and ensure every requirement maps to the right phase and status. The research confirmed the current state is already accurate except for needing the date update.

NOTE: Do NOT check the SESS-01 checkbox yet — it remains pending until Phase 11 execution completes the SessionsTable fix.
  </action>
  <verify>
Read the updated REQUIREMENTS.md and confirm: (a) INFR-01-11 all show `[x]` Complete, (b) SITE-01-06 all show `[ ]` Dropped, (c) SESS-01 shows `[ ]` Pending with Phase 11 mapping, (d) Coverage section is accurate, (e) Last updated date is 2026-02-20.
  </verify>
  <done>
REQUIREMENTS.md traceability is 100% accurate: all requirement checkbox states match actual implementation status, all phase mappings are correct, coverage summary is accurate, and the document is timestamped.
